🏙️ SkyTrade: Air Rights Smart Contract

🌟 Overview

SkyTrade is an innovative smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain, designed to facilitate the creation, management, and trading of air rights parcels. This system allows property owners to tokenize and trade the unused airspace above their buildings, opening up new possibilities in urban development and real estate markets.

🚀 Features

Create Air Rights Parcels: Tokenize your airspace as unique digital assets. Transfer Ownership: Securely transfer air rights to other addresses. List for Sale: Make your air rights parcels available on the market. Delist Parcels: Remove your parcels from the marketplace at any time. Event Logging: All actions are logged for transparency and traceability.

📊 Smart Contract Structure

Key Components

AirRightsParcel: Represents a single air rights parcel. AirRightsRegistry: Manages all air rights for an account. Event Structures: Track creation, transfer, listing, and delisting of parcels.

initialize: Set up the contract for a new account. create_air_rights: Mint a new air rights parcel. transfer_air_rights: Change ownership of a parcel. list_air_rights: Make a parcel available for sale. delist_air_rights: Remove a parcel from the market.

💻 Usage

To interact with the SkyTrade contract:

Only parcel owners can transfer, list, or delist their air rights. Parcels must be delisted before transferring ownership. All functions include appropriate assertions to ensure valid operations.

🌈 Future Enhancements

Implement a marketplace for buying and selling air rights. Add support for fractional ownership of parcels. Integrate with real-world property data and zoning regulations.
